# Letâ€™s Go Software Development Team!

## Hi There!

My name is John Eric B. Samillano, taking a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My year and Section is 1-3!

Software Development is an interest that I've been exploring. It's cool how certain codes can do functions that could help the world!
Although to be honest, I have no big background in Software Development. As a freshman, I'm still exploring various fields! So far, the webinars I have attended
offer Web Development and Cloud Infrastructure. I am also a DTI x Google Scholar, and I am taking Data Analytics Lessons in their program!

## Ang dami namang tinatry???!!

Haha yes, I am still trying to find my specific niche. I'm quite adventurous so trying many fields could help me see what I'm really into. But I know my limits,
and I'll see what I really love if I expose myself to it.
